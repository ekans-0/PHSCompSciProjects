# PHSCompSciProjects

This is a list of all the Computer Science related projects that I am doing at my school.

Currently I have one project: 

***1. Cipher Project***
   * This is a project that consists of implementing an interface, 3 different types of ciphers, and also a main using OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is a week-long project that culminates in this simple program.
